                skeptical) that your expediting service would actually result in our receiving the passports the day after you received our
                applications - in a word...fantastic!!!<br><Br>Love, T.S.',

                sure I didn\'t make any \'little errors\' that might have delayed my passport and caused me to miss my trip (I almost forgot
                to sign my application but your phone rep caught it while reviewing my materials over the phone before I sent it to you).

                getting the passport in time. I\'m telling everyone about you!<br><Br>Thanks again, M.C.',

                job. I was supposed get my passport months ago, but procrastination got the best of me (I\'m sure you\'ve never heard that before!)
